# ATtiny85 Gift Box

A compact, ATtiny85-powered keychain featuring a 0.96-inch OLED screen. This project was created as a token of appreciation for the teachers and technicians who contributed to my growth as an engineer during my bachelor's degree.

## Components

- ATtiny85 microcontroller
- 0.96-inch OLED screen
- Lipo Battery
- Battery charger IC
- Push buttons
- Switch
- Wires
- Keychain ring


For programming:
- Arduino UNO (used as a programmer for the ATtiny chip)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

> [!NOTE]
> The Arduino UNO is only used as a programmer for the ATtiny85 chip and is not part of the final product.

## Programming the ATtiny85

To flash the ATtiny85 with the code, use the following setup:

## Assembly

After programming the ATtiny85, assemble the components according to the circuit diagram. The final product should look similar to this:
